MATH433 Spring 2021 Art (+Data and Randomness) project\
For this project, we created art inspired by a living artist with an identity or identities often marginalized in the art world.\
This was originally undertaken as part of a group project for a senior seminar on math modeling at Williams College in spring 2021.\
This code uses the turtle module to recreate art in the style of Loretta Pettway Bennett, who is part of the Gee's Bend quilting collective in Alabama.\
Included in this repository are the code for the turtle and a pdf of the final project submission.
